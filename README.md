# Plant Friend :seedling: documentation
The Plant Friend project's goal is to make you take really good care of your houseplants.

Have you ever forgotten the last time you watered a plant and ended up overwatering or underwatering the poor thing? With Plant Friend you can keep track of your watering schedule and the needs of your plants.
